# jupydoc

This package allows a Jupyterlab user to produce nicely formatted documention of an analysis,
at the same time as performing the analysis.
It employs the docstring of a function, interpreted as markdown. As such, in can include LaTex and figures, reflecting 
processing of the function.

See the [document](https://tburnett.github.io/jupydoc) which was generated by [this code](jupydoc/document.py).

To try out the development version, put its single folder into your path (get it via clone or zip).
On the road to PyPI, the version from a pypi learning test can be installed thus:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps jupydoc-tburnett

```


Here is a simple hello world, code in a Jupyter code cell:

```
from jupydoc import Publisher

class Hello(Publisher):
    
    def sayhi(self, to):
        """
        Hello there, {to}!
        """
        self.publishme()
h =Hello()
h.sayhi('world')
```
which displays, below the code cell, the following:
`Hello there, world!`
