# jupydoc

This package, essentially a single python file. allows a Jupyterlab user to document analyses for distribution with little effort,
with all details of the document embedded in the python source, especially docstrings. 
See the [document](https://tburnett.github.io/jupydoc) which was generated by [this code](jupydoc/document.py).

It is here to get some feedback. There is no interface documentation yet.

To try it out, put its single folder into your path (get it via clone or zip).
(About to put in PyPI.)

Here is a simple hello world, code in a Jupyter code cell:

```
from ju_doc import Publisher

class Hello(Publisher):
    
    def sayhi(self, to):
        """
        Hello there, {to}!
        """
        self.publishme()
h =Hello()
h.sayhi('world')
```
which displays, below the code cell, the following:
`Hello there, world!`
